# fetlife-obsidian-sync

Synchronous FetLife download data to various places

This project provides a command line tool to read data from the Fetlife exported data function and update
an Obsidian vault with the data.

Specifically, it reads the blocked users and private notes and updates markdown files in the vault, creating new
notes if needed.
